## Inference vs. Prediction

The primary goal in machine learning dictates the choice between an inference or a prediction model, starting with the business question.

***
### Core Distinction

* **Inference (Causal) Models: Understanding Drivers ❓➡️💡**
    * **Focus:** Identify "drivers" and their importance to an outcome (e.g., churn, fraud). Answers "Why?" or "What are the main indicators?"
    * **Goal:** Provide **interpretable insights** (easy to understand and explain).
    * **Characteristics:** Generally less complex, which can mean lower predictive accuracy.
    * **Example Use:** "What are the main drivers of fraud?" (seeking causal insights). Model focuses on how attributes affect fraud probability for strategic decisions.

* **Prediction Models: Achieving Best Guess 🔮**
    * **Focus:** Achieve the **best possible prediction** of an outcome.
    * **Goal:** Maximize accuracy, even if the model is a "black box" (complex and not easily interpretable).
    * **Characteristics:** Can learn complex patterns, leading to superior accuracy.
    * **Example Use:** "Identify which transactions are likely fraudulent?" (assigning risk probability). Model focuses on the most accurate fraud prediction to act on risky transactions.

***
### Data Context

Both model types typically use:
* A **target variable** (what is being predicted, e.g., fraud probability).
* **Input features** (data points about the subject, e.g., transaction details, customer history).
Models use these features to predict the target.

***
### The Key Dilemma

Choose based on primary need:
* **Inference:** Prioritize understanding *why* something happens (interpretability, insights for strategy), potentially sacrificing some predictive accuracy.
* **Prediction:** Prioritize determining *what* will happen with the highest accuracy, potentially sacrificing interpretability.
## Inference (Causal) Models

Inference (causal) models aim to identify **how actions or conditions affect specific outcomes**, answering "Why?" questions (e.g., "Why did sales increase?"). They prioritize **interpretability** over predictive accuracy and typically use **observational data** (data collected without a formal experiment).

***
### Experiments vs. Observational Data

* **Experiments:** Preferred for establishing causality as they are more accurate and yield stronger conclusions. However, they aren't always feasible due to ethical, cost, or practical limitations.
* **Observational Data & Causal Models:** Used when experiments are not possible. Researchers analyze existing data to infer causal relationships (e.g., studying health impacts of accidental chemical exposure).

***
### Best Practices for Approach

1.  **Experiment First:** If possible, conduct an experiment (faster, more accurate).
2.  **Periodic Experiments:** If full experimentation isn't feasible, run them less frequently to establish baselines.
3.  **Inference Model:** Build an inference model only if experiments are not an option.

### Example: Understanding Customer Spend Drivers

* **Goal:** Understand how features like last month's spend, purchase recency, average cart size, and store visits impact a customer's next month spend (the target variable).
* **Output: Regression Coefficients**
    * These numbers show **how much each feature affects the outcome**.
    * **Magnitude:** Larger absolute value = bigger effect.
    * **Sign:** Positive (+) means an increase in the feature increases the outcome; negative (-) means an increase in the feature decreases the outcome.
* **Interpretation Example:** If "last month spend" has a coefficient of `0.58`, it suggests that, on average, for every additional $1 a customer spent last month, they are likely to spend $0.58 more next month (all else being equal).

## Prediction Models: Unsupervised Learning

**Core Concept:**
* Models operate **without a target variable**.
* Primary goal is often **clustering**: grouping similar observations/elements together.

**Key Use Cases:**
* **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on shared characteristics.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying observations that fall outside discovered regular patterns or clusters. This can then feed into supervised models or decision-making.
* **Recommender Engines:** Suggesting items (e.g., movies on Netflix, products on Amazon).

**Clustering Example: Customer Segmentation**
* **Data Used:** Customer data with variables like:
    * Annual Spend (Monetary Value)
    * Recency (days since last purchase)
    * Store Visits in last 12 months (Frequency)
* **Process:** An algorithm uses these data points to discover and form clusters of similar customers.
* **Analysis:** Clusters are analyzed by examining the average values of the input variables for each group.
    * **Example Discovered Segments:**
        1.  **Segment 1:** Medium spend, less recent purchases (avg. >2 months), high visit frequency (avg. 74 visits).
        2.  **Segment 2:** Highest spend, very recent purchases, medium visit frequency.
        3.  **Segment 3:** Lowest spend, pretty recent purchases, low visit frequency.
